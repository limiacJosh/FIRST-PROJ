              <h2><br><br><br><img src="images/kidteach.jpg" width="75" height="75">Marshall D. Teach</h2>
              <p>Blackbeard is an extremely tall man with dark skin, being exactly twice Luffy's (pre-timeskip) height. He has a massive build as his body is round with relatively thin limbs. He has a big mouth with several broken or missing teeth (though sometimes he does have a full set, which is an inconsistency error made by Oda)</p>
              <h2><img src="blackbeards/burgess.jpg" width="75" height="75">Burgess</h2>
              <p>Jesus Burgess is an unusually big, tall, broad, broad-chested, broad shouldered, tan-skinned, muscular man, with a broad upper body and a thin lower body in comparison. He has curly violet hair reaching down to his shoulders and always wears a dark brown mask with orange decorations on it, which covers the upper part of his face but reveals his eyes and his nose. He appears to be based on Luchador wrestlers based on his name and the face mask of Mexican origin.</p>
              <h2><img src="blackbeards/shiryu.jpg" width="75" height="75">Shiryu</h2>
              <p>He was originally introduced as the ex-Head Jailer of Impel Down, who had himself been imprisoned on Level 6 death row for his excessive, murderous violence against prisoners. When temporarily released to help Magellan quell the prison riot caused by Monkey D. Luffy and Marshall D. Teach coming to Impel Down, he chose to go against what he was ordered and instead assist the Blackbeard Pirates, ultimately deciding to join them.</p>
              <h2><img src="blackbeards/van.jpg" width="75" height="75">Van Augur</h2>
              <p>Augur is a rather thin man, with light brown hair that hangs down to his lower neck. He is extremely tall, standing at around the same height as Blackbeard, who is over 11 feet tall. He appears calm all the time, even in battles, and his typical expression is generally emotionless. His eyebrows are almost always furrowed in what looks like a saddened expression, and he rarely smiles.</p>
              <h2><img src="blackbeards/avalo.jpg" width="75" height="75">Avalo Pizarro</h2>
              <p>Avalo Pizarro also known as the "Corrupt King", was one of the criminals who was given a life sentence in Level 6 of Impel Down, as his crimes were so atrocious he had to be effectively be erased from history. Prior to his life of crime, he was once a king of a North Blue kingdom that overthrew him for his despotic ways. He has since been freed by Marshall D. Teach and has become a member of the Blackbeard Pirates.</p>

            <div class="column" style="background-color:transparent">
                <h2><br><br><br><img src="blackbeards/laffi.jpg" width="88" height="75"> Laffitte</h2>
                <p>Laffitte, nicknamed "Demon Sheriff", is the navigator, chief of staff, one of the Ten Titanic Captains, and captain of the Fifth Ship of the Blackbeard Pirates. He is also a former West Blue policeman known for countless acts of police brutality, which resulted in his exile from that sea.</p>
                <h2><img src="blackbeards/devon.jpg" width="75" height="75">Catarina Devon</h2>
                <p>Catarina Devon, known as the "Crescent Moon Hunter", was the most dangerous female pirate ever to be imprisoned in Impel Down within the entire age of pirates. She was freed by Marshall D. Teach. She is currently one of the Ten Titanic Captains, and the captain of the Sixth Ship of the Blackbeard Pirates.</p>
                <h2><img src="blackbeards/sanjuan.jpg" width="75" height="75">Sanjuan Wolf</h2>
                <p>Sanjuan Wolf is an enormous giant, known as "Colossal Battleship" for his size, and was originally one of the legendary criminals who was given a life sentence in Level 6 of Impel Down, as his crimes were so atrocious they had to effectively be erased from history itself. He was initially mentioned briefly by Emporio Ivankov.</p>
                <h2><img src="blackbeards/vasco.jpg" width="75" height="75">Vasco</h2>
                <p>Vasco Shot, monikered "Heavy Drinker", is one of the Ten Titanic Captains of the Blackbeard Pirates, as captain of its Eighth Ship. He was originally one of several legendary criminals given a life sentence on Impel Down's Level 6, before being freed by Blackbeard and joining him.</p>
                <h2><img src="blackbeards/docq.jpg" width="75" height="75">Doc Q</h2>
                <p>Doc Q known as "Death God", is the Doctor of the Blackbeard Pirates. Ironically, he has a sick body and needs his horse, Stronger (who is just as sick as he is), to get around. He is currently one of the Ten Titanic Captains and the captain of the Ninth Ship of the Blackbeard Pirates.</p>
