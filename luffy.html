              <h2><br><br><br><img src="images/kidluffy.jpg" width="75" height="75">Luffy</h2>

He has a scar under his left eye, which he earned by stabbing himself under the eye with a knife. He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Battle of Marineford, leaving an X-shaped scar on his chest.</p>
              <h2><img src="images/kidzoro.jpg" width="75" height="75">Zoro</h2>
              <p>Zoro has a stern, serious, and distanced personality, but unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his short-tempered and impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps.</p>

Until Franky joined the crew, he was also in charge of repairing the ship. Usopp's personality is cowardly and negative.</p>
              <h2><img src="images/kidsanji.jpg" width="75" height="75">Sanji</h2>
              <p>Sanji is a slim, muscular, long-legged man with blond hair which he keeps brushed over one side of his face. Before the timeskip, this was the left side. After the two year timeskip, he switched his hairstyle so that it covers the right side.</p>
